# DataScience Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science project presented in the form of **iPython Notebooks**,completed by me for self learning and **Training** purposes.Still learning and working.


# ML_Micro_Projects

- [HealthCare_Prediction](https://github.com/sasikala07/Portfolio/blob/main/Ml_micro_project/healthcare_stroke_detection.ipynb) :
A model to predict whether the pateint likely to get stroke or not.Identified the best **F1 Score** model to get accurate result in prediction.perform data visualization using **matplotlib and seaborn**.

- [Sentiment_Analysis](https://github.com/sasikala07/Portfolio/blob/main/Ml_micro_project/Amazon_musical_instrument_sentiment_analysis.ipynb):
A model to analysis the feedback of Amazon musical instrument using **sentiment analysis**.Identified the most used words and handle imbalanced data using **SMOTE** oversampling.Build Model which has highest accuracy in classifying the feedback as positive,Negative and neutral.

- [Recommendation_System](https://github.com/sasikala07/Portfolio/blob/main/Ml_micro_project/Imdb_movies_recommendation_collaborative_and%20content_based_filtering.ipynb):
A model to recommend similar movies using both **Collaborative Filtering and Content Based Filtering** recommendation system.Performed NLP **TFIDF Vectorize**.
Preprocessing.



# End-End ML Project

- [Marriage_Prediction](https://github.com/sasikala07/Portfolio/tree/main/End-End%20Project) :
A Model build using **RandomForest Regresion algorithm** and hosted local **REST API** with **Flask** web-server for predicting your **Year of Marriage**. Deployed public API to **AWS EC2 server** and launch website service. [http://3.140.249.198/](http://3.140.249.198/).Given below is the image that shows year of marriage.

# DL_PROJECT

- [ChatBot](https://github.com/sasikala07/Portfolio/tree/main/DL_project):
A Model using **tensorflow.Keras** build a basic ChatBot GUI with tkinter. Import **nltk** and lemmatize each words,compile the model with **stochastic gradient descent** and predict output intent with **softmax**. Given below is the image shows the GUI of chatbot
